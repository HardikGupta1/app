# Assignment Requirements Checklist ✅

## Core Requirements

### Page Flow
- ✅ **Page 1 – Basic Info**
  - Full Name field
  - Email field  
  - Age field
  - "Next" navigates to Page 2
  - Data stored in Redux as draft profile

- ✅ **Page 2 – Address Info**

  - Edit button (goes back to edit)

- ✅ **Home Screen**
  - List of all saved profiles
  - Each item has Edit/Delete buttons
  - "+ Add Profile" button starts new entry

## Technical Requirements

- ✅ **React Native**: Functional components used throughout
- ✅ **TypeScript**: 
  - Interfaces for state (ProfileState, ProfileData, DraftProfile)
  - Interfaces for props (component props typed)
  - Interfaces for actions (Redux actions typed)
  
- ✅ **Redux Toolkit**: 
  - createSlice used for profile management
  - Async thunks for operations
  - Proper actions and reducers
  
- ✅ **React Navigation**: 
  - Stack Navigator (via Expo Router)
  - Proper screen transitions
  
- ✅ **Local Redux State**: All data managed in Redux store
  
- ✅ **Basic Validation**: 
  - Required field validation
  - Email format validation
  - Age range validation (1-150)

## Bonus Features

- ✅ **Persist data using AsyncStorage**: Profiles saved to device storage
- ❌ **Image picker for user avatar**: Removed as per user request
- ✅ **Loading state**: Simulated async actions with setTimeout
